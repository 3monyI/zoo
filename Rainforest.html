<p>Bengals are large cats with a beautiful dark orange color and black stripes. They have white fur around their eyes and around their collars which extends to their underbellies. They also have large paws, a long curled tail, and are a little more slender in appearance than some of their tiger cousins.
    They weigh approximately 400 - 600 lbs.</P>
