<h1>Polar Habitat</h1>
<p>Polar habitats cover the top and bottom of planet Earth at the North and South Poles. The North Pole is surrounded by the Arctic Ocean. There isnâ€™t any land here, just a group of continually shifting ice sheets.</p>

     <br> <p>Polar Bear</p>
<p>The largest bear in the world and the Arctic's top predator, polar bears are a powerful symbol of the strength and endurance of the Arctic. Polar bears spend over 50% of their time hunting for food. A polar bear might catch only one or two out of 10 seals it hunts, depending on the time of year and other variables.</p>

     <br> <p>Harp Seals</p>
<p>Harp seals live throughout the cold waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Harp seals spend most of their time diving and swimming in the icy waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. They are able to remain submerged for up to 15 minutes.</p>
