<h1>Ocean Habitat</h1>
<p>It's a big place, joining small seas and covering over 70% of the Earth's surface. In fact, the ocean habitat is the largest habitat on Earth. The ocean is a marine habitat, which means, it contains 35g of salt for every kilogram of water and is incredibly salty.</p>

     <br> <p>Sea Turtles</p>
<p>Sea turtles are reptiles remarkably suited to life in the sea. Their hydrodynamic shape, large size, and powerful front flippers allow them to dive to great depths and swim long distances. These front flippers are long, narrow, and winglike, while their hind flippers are shorter.</p>

<br> <p>Sharks</p>
<p>Sharks are fishes. Like other fishes, sharks are cold-blooded, have fins, live in the water, and breathe with gills. A shark's skeleton is made of cartilage. A shark's fusiform (rounded and tapering at both ends) body shape reduces drag and requires minimum energy to swim.</p>
