<h1>Desert Habitat</h1>
<p>Deserts are places that don't get much rain, and are very dry. They can be either hot places, or cold places. Because deserts don't have much water, animals that live in the desert are able to conserve water and keep their body temperature at the right level.</p>

<p>Bactrian camels have two humps on their backs where they store fat. Their nostrils close to block sand, and their bushy eyebrows and two rows of long eyelashes protect their eyes from blowing sand and ice.</p>
